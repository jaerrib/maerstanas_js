    <h1>How to play Mǽrstánas</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This web version of Mǽrstánas uses the 0.2.0 rule set.</em></p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Mǽrstánas is a free libre open source abstract strategy game where players alternate placing stones within the
      squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points ("hinges") between their own pieces or the edges
      of the board.
    </p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Players try to achieve the highest score by making the most number of connections.</p>
    <h3>Starting the game</h3>
    <p>The board begins empty (similar to Go). Traditionally, the player using the darker colored stones would play
      first, but players may decide who goes first in whatever manner seems appropriate. Players then alternate taking
      turns.</p>
    <h2>Playing the game</h2>
    <p>On a player's turn, the player places one stone (<em>stán</em>) on a square on the game board. Stones
      (<em>stánas</em>) must be placed within the square, not on the intersections as in Go. Stones may be placed on any
      empty square, either standing alone or adjacent to another stone of either color (creating a <em>heorr</em> or
      "hinge").</p>
    <h3>Placement limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Stones may have no more than <strong>three</strong> hinges; the fourth side <em>must always remain free</em>.
      Stones may not be placed such that four hinges are created immediately. The edge of the board counts as
      <strong>one</strong> hinge; corners count as <strong>two</strong> because they border two edges. Play continues
      until no more viable moves remain.
    </p>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      Players receive one point for each stone or edge that is adjacent to one of their own stones (<em>freóndlíc
        heorr</em> or "friendly hinge"). The player with the highest score wins. Note that tie games are possible.
